Conway's Game of Life in **Rust**. Itâ€™s a fun way for me to learn Rust while building a classic simulation.

### What's in it?

So far, it's really simple. It generates a random seed and runs the simulation until a steady or repeating state is reached.

### Running the Simulation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdambski/rusty-game-of-life.git
cd rusty-game-of-life
cargo run
```
